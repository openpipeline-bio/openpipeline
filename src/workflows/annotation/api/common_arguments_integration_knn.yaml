    - name: Leiden clustering options
      arguments:
        - name: "--leiden_resolution"
          type: double
          description: Control the coarseness of the clustering. Higher values lead to more clusters.
          default: [1]
          multiple: true

    - name: Neighbor classifier arguments
      arguments:
        - name: "--weights"
          type: string
          default: "uniform"
          choices: ["uniform", "distance"]
          description: |
            Weight function used in prediction. Possible values are:
            `uniform` (all points in each neighborhood are weighted equally) or 
            `distance` (weight points by the inverse of their distance)
        - name: "--n_neighbors"
          type: integer
          default: 15
          required: false
          description: |
            The number of neighbors to use in k-neighbor graph structure used for fast approximate nearest neighbor search with PyNNDescent. 
            Larger values will result in more accurate search results at the cost of computation time.
