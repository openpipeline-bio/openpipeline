functionality:
  name: score_genes
  description: |
    Calculates the score associated to S phase and G2M phase and annotates the cell cycle phase for each cell, as implemented by scanpy. 
    The score is the average expression of a set of genes subtracted with the average expression of a reference set of genes.
