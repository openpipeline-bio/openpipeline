functionality:
  name: score_genes
  description: |
    The script takes in a gene expression dataset and a list of genes, and then calculates gene scores based on the expression levels of the provided genes. It uses the Scanpy and MuData libraries to read and write the dataset, and to perform the gene scoring. The resulting gene scores are then written back to the dataset.
  argument_groups:

    - name: Inputs
      arguments:
        - name: --input
          type: file
          description: Input h5mu file
          required: true
          example: input_file.h5mu
        - name: --gene_list
          type: file
          description: |
            Path to a .txt file containing the gene list to be scored. The gene list file should be formatted as a single column with gene symbols.
          required: true
          example: gene_list.txt
        - name: --gene_pool
          type: file
          description: |
            File with genes for sampling the reference set. Default is all genes. The gene pool file should be formatted as a single column with gene symbols.
          required: false
          example: gene_pool.txt

    - name: Outputs
      arguments:
        - name: --output
          type: file
          direction: output
          description: |
            Output h5mu file
          required: true
          example: output_file.h5mu

    - name: Arguments
      arguments:
        - name: --ctrl_size
          type: integer
          default: 50
          required: false
          description: |
            Number of reference genes to be sampled from each bin. If len(gene_list) is not too low, you can set ctrl_size=len(gene_list).
        - name: --n_bins
          type: integer
          default: 25
          required: false
          description: |
            Number of bins for discretizing expression. A larger number of bins will result in scores that are more specific to individual cell states, but also noisier.
        - name: --score_name
          type: string
          default: score
          required: false
          description: |
            Name of the field to be added in .obs.
        - name: --random_state
          type: integer
          description: |
            Random seed to use: providing a value will make the results deterministic.
          default: 0
          required: false
        - name: --use_raw
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether to use raw attribute of adata. Defaults to True if .raw is present.
