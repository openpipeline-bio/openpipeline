    A wrapper for the BD Rhapsody Analysis CWL v1.10.0 pipeline.

    The CWL pipeline file is obtained by cloning 'https://bitbucket.org/CRSwDev/cwl/src/master/' and removing all objects with class 'DockerRequirement' from the YML.

    The reference_genome and transcriptome_annotation files can be downloaded from these locations:
      - Human: http://bd-rhapsody-public.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Rhapsody-WTA/GRCh38-PhiX-gencodev29/
      - Mouse: http://bd-rhapsody-public.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Rhapsody-WTA/GRCm38-PhiX-gencodevM19/
