    BD Rhapsody Sequence Analysis CWL pipeline v2.2.1
    
    This pipeline performs analysis of single-cell multiomic sequence read (FASTQ) data. The supported
    sequencing libraries are those generated by the BD Rhapsody assay kits, including: Whole Transcriptome
    mRNA, Targeted mRNA, AbSeq Antibody-Oligonucleotides, Single-Cell Multiplexing, TCR/BCR, and
    ATAC-Seq

    The CWL pipeline file is obtained by cloning 'https://bitbucket.org/CRSwDev/cwl' and removing all objects with class 'DockerRequirement' from the YAML.

    description: |
      Assay type will be inferred from the provided reference(s).
      Do not provide both reference_archive and targeted_reference at the same time.
      
      Valid reference input combinations:
        - reference_archive: WTA only
        - reference_archive & abseq_reference: WTA + AbSeq
        - reference_archive & supplemental_reference: WTA + extra transgenes
        - reference_archive & abseq_reference & supplemental_reference: WTA + AbSeq + extra transgenes
        - reference_archive: WTA + ATAC or ATAC only
        - reference_archive & supplemental_reference: WTA + ATAC + extra transgenes
        - targeted_reference: Targeted only
        - targeted_reference & abseq_reference: Targeted + AbSeq
        - abseq_reference: AbSeq only

      The reference_archive can be generated with the bd_rhapsody_make_reference component.
      Alternatively, BD also provides standard references which can be downloaded from these locations:
