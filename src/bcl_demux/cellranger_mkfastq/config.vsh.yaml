  description: "Run Illumina demultiplexer on sample sheets that contain 10x-specific sample index sets, and generate 10x-specific quality metrics after the demultiplex. Any bcl2fastq argument will work (except a few that are set by the pipeline to ensure proper trimming and sample indexing). The FASTQ output generated will be the same as when running bcl2fastq directly."
