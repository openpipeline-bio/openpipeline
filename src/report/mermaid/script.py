# Requests docs on timeout parameter:
# The timeout parameter takes as value a tuple (connect, read)
# The connect timeout is the number of seconds Requests will wait for 
# your client to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the connect()) 
# call on the socket. Itâ€™s a good practice to set connect timeouts to slightly larger than a multiple of 3.
# Once your client has connected to the server and sent the HTTP request, '
# the read timeout is the number of seconds the client will wait for the server to send a response.
